# Frogchestra

## What
Do you like frogs? Do you like music? Do you have a desktop with a keyboard? Do you have too much time on your hands and are looking for a way to kill it by utilizing all three of the aforementioned things?

Fret not, friend - Frogchestra is here! 

Frogchestra is an online desktop application where all the keys in your piano are frogs, and you can play them with your keyboard. Play your favourite songs, compose thoughtful moonlight sonatas, or just hit random keys to create a unique atmosphere. There is no way to record or play back your music, just like there isn't on a real piano or real frog pond, so let it all out!

## Why
Because frogs are cute, and making music is fun, and the name sounds catchy. There is no deeper meaning behind it than that. 

## How
The frogchestra was created with html, javascript and css in CÂ´VSCode, as well as custom-made sounds and hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds, which were done in Krita.

The code sorts the frogs into whole notes and half-notes - front row and back row - and assigns each of them a custom ID, a key on the keyboard, a unique sound from the library, and two sprites. Once the event listener notices a key is pressed, the frog enters an active state that corresponds with the audio being played and a different sprite being displayed. Different audios can be played simultaneously this way, but will always start from the beginning if a key is pressed repeatedly.   

## Who
Just me and the thirteen frogs greeting you when you open the website.
