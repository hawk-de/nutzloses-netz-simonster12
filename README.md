# Frogchestra

## What
Do you like frogs? Do you like music? Do you have a desktop with a keyboard? Do you have too much time on your hands and are looking for a way to kill it by utilizing all three of the aforementioned things?

Fret not, friend - Frogchestra is here! 

Frogchestra is an online desktop application where all the keys in your piano are frogs, and you can play them with your keyboard. Play your favourite songs, compose thoughtful moonlight sonatas, or just hit random keys to create a unique atmosphere. There is no way to record or play back your music, just like there isn't on a real piano or real frog pond, so let it all out!

## Why
Because frogs are cute, and making music is fun. 

## How
The frogchestra was created with html, javascript, css, custom-made sounds and hand-drawn sprites and backgrounds. 

## Who
Just me and the thirteen frogs greeting you when you open the website.
